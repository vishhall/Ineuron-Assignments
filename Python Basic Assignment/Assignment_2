1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer: True and False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators? 
Answer: AND,OR and NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer:		OPERATOR 	OR 		  AND		  NOT
	TRUE		TRUE	= 	TRUE		TRUE		FALSE
	TRUE		FALSE	=	  TRUE		FALSE		FALSE
	FALSE		TRUE	=	  TRUE		FALSE		TRUE
	FALSE   FALSE	= 	FALSE		FALSE		TRUE
  
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) : FALSE
not (5 > 4)	: FALSE
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) : TRUE
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) : FALSE
(True and True) and (True == False) : FALSE
(not False) or (not True): TRUE

5. What are the six comparison operators? <,>,<=,>=,==,!=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Single ‘=’ is assigning a value.
A=5
‘==’ is checking whether whether the 2 types match. A==B

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
  spam = 0
  if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
  if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
  else:
  print('ham')
  print('spam')
  print('spam')

Output:
	ham
	spam
	spam
	
		
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Code: 
b=input("Enter a number")
a=int(b)
if a==1:
    		print("Hello")
elif a==2:
   		 print("Howdy")
else:
   		print("Greetings")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press? Ctrl+C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue? 
	Break: Once the condition is met it breaks the current loop and passes the control to the next loop or statement. 
	Continue: It skips the current iteration and executes the next iteration.
  
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10) – Counts is 10 ,
 range(0, 10) – starts from 0 to 10 
range(0, 10, 1) – starts from 0 to 10 and skips the index by 1 position.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
	For loop
for i in range(10):
  		  print(i)
	While Loop
  i=1
  while(i<10):
       print(i)		
       i+=1
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Spam.bacon()
